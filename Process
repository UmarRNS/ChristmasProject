'''On our first class, me and Simon designed our toy, coming up with multiple 
ideas for designs and making a few drafts using paint 3d'''

'''Next class, we began to create models for what we needed to be 3d printed and eventually sent them
to be 3d printed. At the same time, we also began to gather materias and work on the wiring.'''

'''The following class, Umar was absent, however Simon began to work on the code for the project from 
the little bit I had created, and managed to get half of the materials ready'''

'''Then, we both made our first draft for the code, and gave the final 3d models we needed printed,
as well as working more on the wiring, however, we couldnt figure out how to get the button working, and began to think we had aimed too high.'''

'''The next class, we began to put things together, although we had some trouble, as so reworked
the design a little bit, and realizing we needed to print something very small to allow the toy to work'''

'''Afterwards, we began to assemble our model an finally got the motor working. However, we could't find out how to make it work with a button, and I had to leave before our next class. '''
